# Next.js Cleanup Summary

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Action:** Removed unused Next.js implementation from project

## Overview
The NPDI application was found to have unused Next.js directories that were not integrated with the current architecture. The project currently uses **React 18 with Vite** for the frontend, not Next.js.

## Current Architecture
- **Backend:** Express.js + Node.js
- **Frontend:** React 18 + Vite
- **Database:** MongoDB with Mongoose
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS

## Removed Directories

### 1. `/npdi-nextjs/` (456 KB)
Complete Next.js application with:
- Next.js 15.4.6 configuration
- TypeScript setup
- API routes for products, CAS lookup, dashboard stats
- App router pages (dashboard, select-profile)
- React 19.1.0 and related dependencies

### 2. `/npdi-app/` (2.6 MB)
Nested duplicate directory containing:
- Duplicate Next.js application
- Duplicate server and client code
- Old package-lock.json files
- Duplicate documentation

## Verification
- No imports or references to Next.js found in active codebase
- All Next.js references were self-contained within removed directories
- Main package.json has no Next.js dependencies
- Client uses Vite (not Next.js) as confirmed in client/package.json

## Benefits of Cleanup
1. **Reduced disk space:** ~3 MB removed (excluding node_modules)
2. **Eliminated confusion:** Clear single architecture (React + Vite)
3. **Simpler maintenance:** No outdated/unused code paths
4. **Cleaner repository:** Only active code remains

## Updated Files
- `.gitignore` - Enhanced with comprehensive patterns for dependencies, build outputs, logs, IDE files, and temporary files

## No Breaking Changes
- Active application (server/ and client/) unaffected
- All functionality remains intact
- Development and production builds still work as expected

## Future Considerations
If Next.js is needed in the future:
1. It can be added as a fresh implementation
2. Consider whether server-side rendering is required
3. Evaluate if Vite + React meets all current needs
4. Next.js would require architectural changes (app router, server components, etc.)

## Validation
✅ No Next.js references in active code  
✅ No broken imports or dependencies  
✅ Project structure simplified  
✅ Documentation accurate (React + Vite)  
✅ .gitignore updated for comprehensive coverage
